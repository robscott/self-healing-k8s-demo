# Deploying Self Healing Services With Kubernetes
This is the code behind my [recent talk at ChaDev](https://www.meetup.com/chadevs/events/239510873/). 
You can use this to follow along with [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsrXifq3Pjc). I was
working exclusively out of the k8s directory for the demo. All the images I was using are included in
the `servers` directory. My slides are available on 
[Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/robscott/deploying-self-healing-services-with-kubernetes).
